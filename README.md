# Problem Statement
Building a check-out system for a bakery so as to improve product sales by improving efficiency and cutting down on processing time all the while not compromising on the size of the product catalogue. Another goal of our program would be to keep a record of all the sales made by the bakery in an attempt to improve accountability of the store and provide a sound database of all transactions, which can help the store in two ways:
1. Dealing with customer complaints:
   If and when any customer has any complaint regarding the bakery's service, keeping a record will help us pinpoint the particular          transaction and help us deal with the matter as swiftly as possible. 
2. Accountability:
   If the institution ever finds itself in the crosshairs of a dispute, having a database of all the transactions made by business            may play a key role in proving its innocence or lack thereof.
And the last problem we identify is that a lot of mom-and-pop stores in several parts of the world still have not adopted checkout systems for their enterprises due to a multitude of factors, the most pressing of them being their lack of understanding of the complicated software that goes into checkout systems and an aversion to change. We believe that if we develop a simpler alternative to the one existing, akin to the code that we shall be submitting, more and more such stores would like to adapt our checkout systems and modernise, which will result in overall greater efficiency and customer satisfaction, but increasing digital literacy among smaller businesses
